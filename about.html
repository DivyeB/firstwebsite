    <p>
        Welcome to my personal website!
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm Divye Bajaj, a student at Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT). I love being creative and I'm excited to share my skills and experiences with you. I'm passionate about different creative activities, like editing photos, designing, and editing videos. I pay close attention to details and have a good sense of what looks good. Whether it's improving pictures, making attractive designs, or editing videos, I always aim to create high-quality work that leaves a strong impression.

        I've learned a lot and become skilled in various tools and techniques. I can turn ordinary images into amazing ones by using special software and techniques that bring out the right mood, look, and composition.Designing is what I enjoy the most. I like coming up with ideas and creating visual experiences that connect with people. I combine my artistic creativity with technical knowledge to make designs that not only look good but also work well. From designing user-friendly interfaces to creating eye-catching marketing materials, I believe that design has the power to communicate ideas and evoke emotions. I also have experience in video editing. I create videos that capture attention and effectively convey messages. I edit videos carefully, making them polished and engaging through smooth transitions, dynamic effects, and attention to detail.Outside of creativity, I have hobbies too. I find joy and self-expression in designing, where I bring ideas to life through sketches and illustrations. I also enjoy gaming, which allows me to explore virtual worlds and connect with others who share similar interests.
